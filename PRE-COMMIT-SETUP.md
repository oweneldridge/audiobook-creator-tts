# Pre-Commit Hook Setup - Summary

## What Was Installed

### 1. Git Pre-Commit Hook
Location: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

The hook runs automatically before each commit and performs three checks:

#### ‚úÖ Black (Code Formatting)
- Ensures all Python files are formatted consistently
- Line length: 120 characters
- Auto-fix: Run `black *.py tests/` to format code

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Flake8 (Linting - Informational)
- Checks code style and quality
- **Does not block commits** - warnings only
- View issues: Run `flake8 *.py tests/`

#### ‚úÖ Pytest (Unit Tests)
- Runs all unit tests
- **Blocks commits if tests fail**
- Fast execution without coverage checks

### 2. Configuration Files

- **`.flake8`** - Flake8 linting rules
- **`pyproject.toml`** - Black, MyPy, and Pytest configurations  
- **`requirements-test.txt`** - Updated with linting tools

### 3. Development Tools Added

```txt
flake8>=7.0.0         # Style guide enforcement
black>=24.0.0         # Code formatter
mypy>=1.8.0          # Static type checker
pylint>=3.0.0        # Code analysis
```

## Usage

### Normal Workflow
```bash
# Make your changes
git add .

# The pre-commit hook runs automatically
git commit -m "Your message"

# If checks fail, fix the issues and try again
```

### Bypassing the Hook
Only use when absolutely necessary:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your message"
```

### Manual Checks
Run checks before committing:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Format code (auto-fix)
black *.py tests/

# Check formatting
black --check *.py tests/

# Run linting
flake8 *.py tests/

# Run tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

## What Gets Checked

### ‚úÖ Enforced (Blocks Commits)
1. **Code Formatting** - All files must be Black-formatted
2. **Unit Tests** - All tests must pass

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Informational (Warnings Only)
1. **Code Style** - Flake8 warns about style issues but doesn't block

## Documentation

See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for complete development guide including:
- Setup instructions
- Testing best practices
- Code quality standards
- Troubleshooting tips

## Performance

- **Fast**: Typical execution < 5 seconds
- **Smart**: Only runs unit tests (not integration tests)
- **Efficient**: No coverage calculation during pre-commit

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Code Style** - Black ensures uniform formatting
2. **Early Bug Detection** - Tests run before code is committed
3. **Code Quality** - Flake8 suggestions improve code quality
4. **Team Collaboration** - Everyone follows the same standards
5. **CI/CD Ready** - Same checks can run in CI pipeline

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Pre-commit hook is active and working
2. Consider adding to CI/CD pipeline
3. Gradually address Flake8 warnings over time
4. Add integration tests to manual workflow
