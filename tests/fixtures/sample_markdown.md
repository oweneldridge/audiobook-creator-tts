# Sample Markdown Document

This is a test document in Markdown format.

## Introduction

Markdown documents should be converted to plain text before processing for text-to-speech conversion.

## Features

The Markdown parser should handle:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Code blocks
- Lists and formatting

## Content

This document contains multiple sections and formatting elements to test the Markdown extraction pipeline. The system should strip all Markdown syntax and retain only the readable text content.

### Subsection

Nested headings should be preserved as text without the markup symbols.

## Conclusion

This sample provides a basic test case for Markdown document processing.
